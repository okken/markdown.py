===========

Yet another Python implementation of markdown

## Status
This is really an abandoned project.  
It's left here due to it's being referenced from the blog.  
But no further development is planned.  

A little more of the project was developed in the [submark](https://github.com/okken/submark) repo.

## Follow along
This project is part of a demo project on [Python Testing](http://pythontest.com).   
You can follow it's progress in the [Markdown category](http://pythontest.com/tags/markdown/).

## Requirements

1. Written in Python
2. Use only Python standard library packages 
3. All contained in one python file
4. Implement enough of the original Markdown functionality to be useful
