This is a doctest based regression suite for unnecessary_math.py
Each '>>>' line is run as if in a python shell, and counts as a test.
The next line, if not '>>>' is the expected output of the previous line.
If anything doesn't match exactly (including trailing spaces), the test fails.

>>> from unnecessary_math import multiply
>>> multiply(3, 4)
12
>>> multiply('a', 3)
'aaa'
